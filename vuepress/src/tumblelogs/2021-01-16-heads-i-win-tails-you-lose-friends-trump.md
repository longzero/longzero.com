Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

That is my summary of Agent Orange's message: “If I win, I win. If I lose, it's fraudulent.”

And people believe him.

“Heads I win, tails you lose” has always been simply a comedic line to me, until 2020-2021 showed me A LOT of people actually believe it, at least 70 million Americans in addition to his supporters around the world.

Too much stupidité.
