The sad thing is, even after yesterday, many people will still deny the existence of white privilege.

And as someone who doesn't live in the USA, I will hear a lot of “it doesn't happen here”.

You should read the book “White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo. I would even say that you should shut the crap up as long as you haven't read that book.

“You boarded up your businesses and sent out your officers and your tear gas when all we said was “Black lives matter,” 

but you stood back, unprepared and surprised when violent white terrorists showed up exactly as they told you they would and put us all in danger.”
